**IRC.app** is a genericized verison of a superb, BSD-licensed IRC client for Mac,
the name of which (being the adjectival form of the word _"text"_) I have
**thoroughly** redacted here to hide from search engines. The upstream product is
sold on the Mac App Store, and I don't want people searching for ``` free ...```
or ```how do I build ...``` to find this and risk cannibalizing sales of the
the 'real thing'. If you like what you find here, you are **strongly** encouraged
to buy it. You can find the upstream source for the here on Github as well,
and the code here has been forked from that, but I've uncoupled the fork from
the original for the same reason. The only real difference here is that it is
slightly easier to build as it does not require a code-signing identity, nor
~~nag~~ warn you about not having one. The links to the support channel, etc. have also been removed.

#### Installing
There is a binary available [here](http://github.com/g-nix/IRC.app/releases/download/3.2.3/IRC.app.zip),
built against the 10.8 SDK.  
~~It is not codesigned, so you'll need to pacify Gatekeeper.~~   
***Update:*** I've decided, for now, to code sign the binary myself, until I have time to cherry-pick
through the code upstream and figure out why, exactly, logging to file doesn't work when the binary is unsigned.
I haven't tested it on anything besides my own machine; and it doesn't mean this is official in any way;
no warranty expressed or implied, etc., etc. So please, instead, consider:

#### Builing Your Own
Requirements: Xcode installed and configured on a Mac running 10.8+.  

Checkout the source, then type:

```
xcodebuild -scheme 'IRC (Standard Release)' -configuration Release -alltargets
```

The app will be in ```Build Results/Release```.
Copy ```IRC.app``` to your Applications folder (or wherever).

#### Support

None.

If you can't figure something out and want support, buy the original from the
Mac App Store. You won't get any support here, and you certainly won't from
the upstream developers. If you think you've found a bug and want to report it,
you'll need to check out the code of the original project and see if the
bug existed there too. If so, file it upstream; if the bug is peculiar to
**this** neutered version, you can file one here or submit a pull request.
Maybe I'll do something about it. 

The code here is based on a checkout of the original project
on 4 October 2013. I may update it from time to time, I may not.

The license below is identical to that of the upstream project, except
(again, so that IRC.app does not appear in searches for the original)
the name of the application has been omitted.
