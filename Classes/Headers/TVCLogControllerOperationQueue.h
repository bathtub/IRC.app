 the main thread but the blocks draw in the background. Once drawing is complete, we 
 execute the rest of the work on the main thread, but that work is not always instant.
 
 By calilng this on the main thread after the work has completed instead of relying on
 the default implementation of isFinish we are making sure our queue can be concurrent
 but also keep stuff in sync. */
