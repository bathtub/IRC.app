	+createConnectionAndJoinChannel:channel:autoConnect: is the method used to
	parse the input of the "/server" command. It also handles input from
	+parseIRCProtocolURI:

	The following syntax is supported by this method and is recommended:

	"-SSL irc.example.com:0000 serverpassword"

	Input can also vary including formats such as:

	"irc.example.com:0000 serverpassword"
	"irc.example.com 0000 serverpassword"

	"irc.example.com:+0000 serverpassword"
	"irc.example.com +0000 serverpassword"

	Of course -SSL being the front most token would favor SSL for the
	connection being created. Additionally, a server port proceeded by
	a plus sign (+) also indicates the connection will be SSL based.

	Server port can be associated with the server using a colon (:) or
	simply making it second to the server using a space.

	The server password passed using the "PASS" command is last in list.
	Nothing should follow it.
