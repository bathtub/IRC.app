        serverConnected                 - Server associated with this view has connected.
        serverConnecting                - Server associated with this view is connecting.

        serverDisconnecting             - Server associated with this view is disconnecting.
        channelJoined                   - Channel associated with this view has been joined.
        channelParted                   — Channel associated with this view has been parted.
        channelMemberAdded              — Member added to the channel associated with this view.
        channelMemberRemoved            — Member removed from the channel associated with this view.
        
		THESE EVENTS ARE PUSHED WHEN THEY OCCUR. When a style is reloaded by IRC or
        the end user, these events are not sent again. It is recommended to use a feature
        of WebKit known as sessionStorage if these events are required to be known between
        reloads. When a reload occurs to a style, the entire HTML and JavaScript is replaced
        so the previous style will actually have no knowledge of the new one unless it is 
        stored in a local database.
